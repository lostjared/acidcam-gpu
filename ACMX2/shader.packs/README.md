Shader packs moved to the Releases section

Shader packs are collections of visual effects files that define how images, textures, and lighting appear in the program. To use them, simply place your desired shader packs into the specified directory. Once they are there, unzip the chosen pack so the program can access its contents. After unpacking, open the program’s File Properties or configuration settings and set the shader pack directory as the active location for the program to load from. Once selected, you can sort or shuffle through the available shaders within the pack to explore different looks, transitions, and visual styles until you find the one that best fits your creative project.
